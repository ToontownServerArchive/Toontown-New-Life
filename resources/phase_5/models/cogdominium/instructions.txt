This is a redesigned exporter I have modified
because I both, couldn't get the standard one to work
due to incompatible coding with the newer Maya programs,
nor, would the thing even fit in the boundary's of
my monitor resolution of 1360x768 once I got a hacked version
able to run.

This script should work on the following:
Maya 2012 through Maya2017
Though I 'think' there was some issue with Maya 2013.
At present time, it will NOT function on Maya 2018,
since currently, the MayaPanda plugins can not be built
do to coding issues.

Copy the two ".mel" files. "MayaPandaUI.mel" & "eggImportOptions.mel" to:
C:\Users\{YOURACCOUNT}\Documents\maya\scripts\

In the above folder, may be a Maya MEL file named "userSetup.mel".
If the userSetup.mel file is NOT present, simply use any text
editor and manually create the file with the entry below,
and make sure to save-as "userSetup.mel".
If the file is present, open it up for editing in something like notepad.
Add the following line entry into it and save it.
source MayaPandaUI.mel;

This file above is used to load scripts on starting up Maya
and can be used for any script the user wishes to load at started time.

"MayaPandaUI.mel" is the main script file of this exporter.
On Maya start-up, the script will place a new menu item on the main menu
inside of Maya, at the top of the Maya GUI.

The file "eggImportOptions.mel" is for a sub menu,
which is used/called when a user runs File>Import.
It creates an option menu inside that GUI window.

Finally, you must copy the two ".mll" from your Panda3d>plugins directory,
that reflect the version of Maya your running, to your
"\Program Files\Autodesk\[MayaVersion]\bin\plug-ins" directory
File to copy to Maya installation:
"mayaeggimport[mayaVersion].mll"
"libmayapview[mayaVersion].mll"

After the above has been done, start up Maya.
Go to "Window>Settings>Preferences>Plug-In Manager"
When the Plug-In Manager GUI opens, find and "Check" the following:
Under "mayaeggimport[mayaVersion].mll"    Check both "Loaded" & "Auto load"
Under "libmayapview[mayaVersion].mll"    Check both "Loaded" & "Auto load"

That's it!  You should now be able to import and export egg and bam files,
along with adding egg-object-types and taking advantage of many export options.

Final Note:
If you just installed the Panda3d SDK and have yet to reboot your computer,
a restart is highly recommended so your computer can find the Panda3d installation!
